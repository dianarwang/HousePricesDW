# Predicting Home Prices in Ames Iowa
In this project, I examined two factors (year built, lot shape) that drive home prices in Ames Iowa. My client was a fictional Investment Bank, who wanted to use my analysis in optimizing fund allocation for their mortgage-backed securities.

### Objective:
To determine how the prices of houses correlate with the years they are built, and their lot shapes

### Tools and Techniques:
- Excel
- Data consolidation, cleaning, validation, range protection
- Inferential statistcs, independent sample T-testing
- Dashboarding

### About:
This was my second project under Thinkful's Data Analytics Immersion Program
